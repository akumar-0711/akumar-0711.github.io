## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/akumar-0711/akumar-0711.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/akumar-0711/akumar-0711.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

# Introduction: What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
- As more and more artists are releasing music using streaming platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, Soundcloud, etc., it is difficult for these artists to get the exposure they need in order to become more popular. We want to create a recommender that takes in data of a user and the kind of music they listen to and generates recommendations for new songs and artists based on that data. Spotify has an enormous amount of content that is similar to the more popular content but simply goes unnoticed. This system is not just to promote the smaller artists that do not get their deserved exposure, but also diversify the kind of content that the user listens to as there may be different genres similar to the common ones.
